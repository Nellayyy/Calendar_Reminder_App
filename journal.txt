5/3/19 - The main thing we all did today was work on the user_activity.xml for the signup/login page for the app, and work on the UserActivity.java 
	to allow the user to choose to sign up or login, and allow the user to create a profile. 
	
5/10/19 - We are finished the UserActivity.java, soon finished with user_activity.xml. This week we started Calendar.java, calendar_activity.xml, 
	ToDoList.java, and todo_activity.xml. We also implemented "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>" 
	and "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"></uses-permission>" into the AndroidManifest.xml.
	
5/20/19 - This week has not been the best for our group to work on the project. The keystones, the odd adjusted schedule, and the senior tripmade us have
	less time to code this app. Some of us plan to take the project home and work on it outside of class in order to get more code done in the application.
	This week we were able to work on and finish some of the xml files (such as calendar_view.xml, stats_view.xml, etc.) thanks to Hayden. 
	Without his designing skills, we wouldn't have the same quality on the xml files.
