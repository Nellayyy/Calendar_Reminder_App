5/3/19 - The main thing we all did today was work on the user_activity.xml for the signup/login page for the app, and work on the UserActivity.java 
	to allow the user to choose to sign up or login, and allow the user to create a profile. 
	
5/10/19 - We are finished the UserActivity.java, soon finished with user_activity.xml. This week we started Calendar.java, calendar_activity.xml, 
	ToDoList.java, and todo_activity.xml. We also implemented "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>" 
	and "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"></uses-permission>" into the AndroidManifest.xml.
