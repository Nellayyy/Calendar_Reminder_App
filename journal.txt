5/3/19 - The main thing we all did today was work on the user_activity.xml for the signup/login page for the app, and work on the UserActivity.java to allow the user to choose to sign up or login, and allow the user to create a profile. 
	
5/10/19 - We are finished the UserActivity.java, soon finished with user_activity.xml. This week we started Calendar.java, calendar_activity.xml, ToDoList.java, and todo_activity.xml. We also implemented "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>" and "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"></uses-permission>" into the AndroidManifest.xml.
	
5/20/19 - This week has not been the best for our group to work on the project. The keystones, the odd adjusted schedule, and the senior tripmade us have less time to code this app. Some of us plan to take the project home and work on it outside of class in order to get more code done in the application. This week we were able to work on and finish some of the xml files (such as calendar_view.xml, stats_view.xml, etc.) thanks to Hayden. Without his designing skills, we wouldn't have the same quality on the xml files. 

5/28/19 - This week we continued our work on the application. We were able to finish the Todolist.java and todolist.xml. We also worked on Event.java as well as event_view.xml. There was a glitch with the login/sign up screen where the login and the sign up button would not go to the calendar after loginning in or signing up. We were able to fix that glitch thanks to the help from Mr. Linburg. This week we tried to find bugs and fix them as soon as we found them.
