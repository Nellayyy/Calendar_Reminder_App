# Calendar Reminder App
This is the Calendar Reminder app created by students at Dover Area High School. The devs of this app are Xavier Davis, Noah Elliott, Adam Huber, Hayden Sanderson, and Frankie White, who is our fearless leader. The goal of this app is to allow users to have the ability to create events and keep track of a calendar, and have fun doing it with stats and achievements. This application will allow friends and family members to collaborate on those events and add to a reminder list for those specific events.
# How to Access it
You need a device with at least API 21 (Lollipop) and above, and a program to put the code on and run it on. Best program to use is Android Studio, which is what we used. Clone the repository into Android Studio and run the program. Until we finish the app, it is not in the Google Store / App Store. 
### Using the App
Once the app loads up, the user will be asked to sign up or log in (if you have already made an account) in order to continue. Once it loads you will see the calendar and you can select a day to create events, collaborate with others on events where you want multiple people on, create a to do list, and be able to see stats of how many events you've completed and how many days in a row events were completed. This encourages the user to complete those tasks and not get off task, through the use of stats and achievements.
